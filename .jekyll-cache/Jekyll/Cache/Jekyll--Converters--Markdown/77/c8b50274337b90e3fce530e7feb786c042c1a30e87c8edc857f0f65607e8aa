<h4 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h4>

<h5 id="11-objective">1.1 Objective</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>A free-to-use web-based “mind-map” application. The app allows the user to render any type of task quickly and easily, thus providing a free hand for visual display.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="12-document-standardization--standardization">1.2 Document standardization / standardization</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mind-map (as-mind-map) - Mind-map is a chart used to visually organize information. The mind-map shows the relationships between hierarchical and whole pieces. It is often created around a concept or object that is drawn as an image in the middle of a blank page, and is associated with ideas and related representations, such as images, words, and parts of words.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="13-description-and-target-group">1.3 Description and target group</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project is a so-called A system based on “boxes” that allows you to display several different (even abstract) topological structures. The surface is thus able to represent virtually all genders and types of layouts in an unbound form. This pattern is most similar to a neural network.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project can be significantly useful in a variety of design processes where the user wants to visualize the process of brainstorming, but especially for creative teams where it needs to be presented quickly and frequently changed across multiple logical processes or operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="14-scope-of-the-project">1.4 Scope of the project</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of the web application is to facilitate the visual thinking of the users and the convenient, easy and purposeful cooperation of the common workflow (s).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Training is the primary competence, helping pupils, students, trainees, etc. to work and / or develop. All this interactively and in a way that provides a comfortable user experience and is also available with a variety of service options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2-general-description">2. General description</h4>

<h5 id="21-product-structure">2.1 Product Structure</h5>

<p>The web-based mind-map system stores the following information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worksheet details
    <blockquote>
      <p>This includes the user-created interface and all box elements, as well as all other editing, settings and modifications. The worksheet actively saves changes and makes saved data traceable.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>User details
    <blockquote>
      <p>Contains personal data about the registered client such as: username, first and last name, date of birth, email address, password, etc .; and depending on the service package or option: token, phone number, scope of activity, etc.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Service description

</blockquote>

<h5 id="23-user-classes-and-their-characteristics">2.3 User classes and their characteristics</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>System users must be able to retrieve their profile from the database, which includes previously created workspaces (WokrSheet) (if any). The system supports two types of user rights: client and admin.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clients can access client features, and admins can access all features of both clients and the web application. The customer must be able to perform the following functions:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Profile configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Modification of personal data</li>
  <li>Workspace settings and controls</li>
  <li>Service package / option management</li>
  <li>Sharing and visibility settings</li>
  <li>Delete / delete profile</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also create, modify and delete an existing workspace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The admin (s) must have the following operating functions:</p>

<p>Manage client functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screening of compliant substances (guidelines)</li>
  <li>Filtering Scam or Bot profiles (guidelines)</li>
  <li>Online Support (HelpDesk)</li>
  <li>Manage customer-selected services / packages</li>
  <li>Calculate the total sales for a given flight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Management of the entire system</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage user / customer profiles (activity)</li>
  <li>Testing / managing / implementing updates (provisional)</li>
  <li>Online traffic monitoring</li>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Authorization (depending on the country - imprinting)</li>
  <li>Network endpoints (servers, switches, routers - position geometry) monitoring</li>
  <li>Logins (online status (s) - list of logged in device (s))</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each cluster server has a limited number of so-called has a “chunk”.
Therefore, network operation and administrator supervision are especially important.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="24-operating--runtime-environment">2.4 Operating / Runtime Environment</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operating environment of the mind-map application system is listed below</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed database (RPi cluster)</li>
  <li>Client / server system</li>
  <li>Operating system: Linux (server)</li>
  <li>Database: sql + database</li>
  <li>Platform (s): HTML / CSS / Java / PHP</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="25-design-and-implementation-restrictions">2.5 Design and Implementation Restrictions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Global correlation (interdependence, interdependence) scheme, fragmentation and allocation topics</li>
  <li>SQL commands for the above queries / applications</li>
  <li>Response to applications 1 (A) and 2 (B), their global (cooperative) collaborative query</li>
  <li>Operation using at least one central database management system (minimum)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="26-terms-and-conditions-appendices">2.6 Terms and Conditions (Appendices)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose this is a distributed web service system used in the following application (location): - (Logged in locations / points / locations)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(Type A) - A call retrieved from any source on the distributed cluster server will be made on the client side and then the received changes will be recorded back on the server side</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Type B) - The central database management system handles the above task / query almost similarly</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming both requests are in the same process, the connections should be synchronized and / or the user should be notified that they are online at multiple points on the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="3-system-features">3. System Features</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Description and priority</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The web application system stores information about user profiles, type of services, personal preferences, prices and subscriptions. Of course, this project is a top priority, as protecting the user points connected to the system is very important for multiple logins.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed / distributed database</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A distributed database means that a single application must be able to operate transparently between data that is distributed in a number of different databases and interconnected by a communication network, as shown below.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Client or server system</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term client / server refers primarily to the architecture or logical division of responsibilities, the client is the application (also known as front-end) and the server is the DBMS (also known as wallpaper) (database management system).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A client / server system is a distributed system in which</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some sites are client pages, others are server pages</li>
  <li>All data is located on the server location</li>
  <li>All applications run on the client site</li>
</ul>
