That means they start with a bootloader and a partition table. You have to find out the offset of the partition and mount it with the offset option of mount.</h6>

<p>Disk Stick.img: 3984 MB, 3984588800 bytes
249 heads, 6 sectors/track, 5209 cylinders, total 7782400 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

<p>The unmount command would be like the whole disk even-though it is not mounted the entire image</p>
