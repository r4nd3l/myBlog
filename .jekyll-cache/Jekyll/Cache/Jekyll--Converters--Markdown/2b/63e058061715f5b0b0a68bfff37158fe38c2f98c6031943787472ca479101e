<p>Changed ability to work as a value that will help you!
Do you need a good workforce or a job in the world of people with disabilities? You‚Äôre in the right place, we‚Äôll help!</p>

<h2 id="we-offer-you-a-supported-workforce-a-job">We offer you a supported workforce, a job!</h2>
<p>If you want to reduce your labor costs without compromising on quality, you can find solutions with us. Tailored to the needs of the employer, we specially prepare employees with altered working abilities for their jobs, whose suitability can be assessed in a cost-effective manner in the framework of probationary work. If you meet your needs and take over for your own employment, there will be a lot of support, discounts and full-time work, as you can see for yourself in advance.</p>

<h2 id="why-choose-us">Why choose us?</h2>
<p>All our employees have changed their ability to work, with many degrees and practical experience. We are fully aware of the situation of the employees involved and can share all the necessary information with them empathetically and based on our own experience. We can also effectively prepare them for a pre-defined job. We take care of the pre-assessment, assess their mental, physical, and mental aptitude, and allow only those who are truly ready to integrate and perform well in the job to try out for a potential employer.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-contact-us">Who should contact us?</h2>
<p>If you have a change in your ability to work and actually want to do useful work, we will help. We can‚Äôt promise a sure solution, but we‚Äôll help you assess your options and find those of our partners who can come to your attention. If you are an employer or simply an entrepreneur who does not have full or even part-time employment but has tasks to solve that someone should do, you are looking for the right place. We can prepare a lot of subsidized workforce in a targeted way, but if the nature of the task is such that it is not worth employing a separate workforce for it, we will perform the task itself with our own workforce in a very cost-effective way. We are sure to find the ideal solution depending on our capacities.</p>

<h2 id="okay-but-how-much-does-that-cost-you">Okay, but how much does that cost you?</h2>
<p>Virtually nothing, because as an accredited employer, we employ workers with state support and prepare them for employment in the open labor market. But nothing is free, and as a non-profit and non-profit company, we also have expenditures that are not covered by state aid. With this in mind, it is possible to support our services in several ways, and we ourselves support non-governmental organizations, social and other charitable activities, primarily through work and the targeted collection of donations. But whatever the challenge that needs to be addressed, we can solve it cost-effectively, to everyone‚Äôs satisfaction, depending on our capabilities.
