I"È<p>So, here we are again! And yes, it is in plural for by now. That means, it‚Äôs been while I‚Äôm not published, but believe me a have a good reason for this! I started my blog to log my process about a new grid, though I started to do work in a group called Envienta.</p>

<p>What we are doing? Well, so many things. The current thread which I‚Äôm work on is the marketplace. It‚Äôs not an common one, keep in mind that. We all know marketplaces around the globe. Like amazon for example. There are several of them. But not like this kind of. It‚Äôs an open-source based ‚Äúhardware-repo‚Äù. Yes, it‚Äôs a sort of git, but for hardware. The goal is to create a marketplace where people are able to download blueprints freely and start building things on their own. Sounds awesome for me!</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the deal right now, and I can‚Äôt wait to begin the project management with them. I‚Äôll continue this blog even I changed the steering wheel and it‚Äôs going to a different direction. All these topics are awesome means I‚Äôve to blog about them!</p>
