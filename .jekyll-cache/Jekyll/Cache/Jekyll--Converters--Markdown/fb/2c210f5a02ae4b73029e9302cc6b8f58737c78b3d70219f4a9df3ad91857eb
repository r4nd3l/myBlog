<p>A certificate of higher education focuses on either a particular profession or academic subject and is the most basic level of qualification that a student can gain in higher education (unlike the postgraduate certificate of higher education, which we look at later).</p>

<p>A Certificate of Higher Education is an academic qualification that is awarded after a year of full-time study or after 2 years of part-time study.</p>

<p>Completing a CertHE can demonstrate individualsâ€™ capability of studying at university level. It can raise confidence, support a career change, or progression in a current career. It can also be used as the first step of several degree levels to go on to achieve a foundation degree, a diploma of higher education or a DipHE or HND (we have plenty of resources to help you out), or a full honours degree through additional study.</p>
