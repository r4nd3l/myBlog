<p>‚Äú The Internet of Things* (IoT) is already boosting productivity to the point where the marginal cost of producing goods and services is nearly zero, making them nearly free. As a result the corporate profits are drying up, the property rights are weakening and an economy based on scarcity is slowly giving way to an economy of abundance.  ‚Äú</p>

  <li>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or ‚Äúthings‚Äù embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.</li>

<p>We confronted with the facts: the end of social safety and infinite growth, huge inequality, collapse of the market economy, political, immigrant crisis and the climate change. We must gradually shift to a harmonic, stable, science-based, inherently sustainable model.</p>

<p>While market economy is unsustainable, there is a new way of thinking that has brought together previously distinct fields ‚Äì chemistry, biology, engineering, architecture, urban planning, IT, social science ‚Äì and now it‚Äôs challenging the standard economic theory. It is defining Earth as a complex.</p>

<p>There are three pillars in order of importance: environment, society, economy. Today the economic interests stand in front of everything. In a sustainable world we have to adjust the social conditions to the environment, just like economic policies, which able to serve the needs of the society.</p>

<p>ENVIENTA is a fast growing, sustainable, cost-effective, non-profit, decentralized and holistic socioeconomic model. If it‚Äôs too abstract, we simplified it to understand by anyone. In modern times, basic human necessities ‚Äì food, water, energy, household objects, furniture and so on, in a reliable form ‚Äì depend on lot of conditions. ENVIENTA was born as a Do it Yourself, community-based solution package for the 21st century, which provides share of know-how, resources, products, food and water for the members. As an open source model, it offers business plans to anyone for free, as well as full transparency.</p>

<p>What is open source? In an open source model, members give their own resources, creativity and experience to the commons, which is a way of self-expression. No one owns the project or the output, it‚Äôs free for anyone to use. This kind of social production is based on cooperation and mutual help.</p>

<p>If anyone can participate in development, our community can easily grow, technological breakthrough appears way faster into our daily life, instead of patent-protected R&amp;D environments. We asked ourselves: what if we‚Äôre calling people from different fields of life working together to open source almost everything in a household? To make our model time and cost-effective, we bring domestic developments under one roof. With holistic approach, it‚Äôs obvious to have few key areas merged into the system.</p>
