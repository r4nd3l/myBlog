<p>Before you start something, you need to imagine how you would like to see the result or almost the final state of that something. But more importantly you have to use a pattern. This pattern could be everything, in my case it is a framework pattern.</p>

<p>I decided to grab other sources as well. This time I found a book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks – Jans Oliver Meiert</p>
</blockquote>

<p>source: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/book-of-html-css-frameworks.csp">https://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/book-of-html-css-frameworks.csp</a></p>

<p>This book is very detailed about the circumstances of a quality framework. It is describing how should be a framework especially a web version, look like.  According to this book, the quality here is not just to make something which is working, but it is should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast</li>
  <li>Accessible</li>
  <li>Semantic</li>
  <li>Robust</li>
  <li>Scalable</li>
  <li>Documented</li>
  <li>Maintainable</li>
  <li>Valid</li>
  <li>Self-explanining</li>
  <li>Consistent</li>
  <li>“Automagical”</li>
  <li>State of the art</li>
  <li>Simple</li>
  <li>Compact</li>
  <li>Flexible</li>
  <li>Tested</li>
  <li>Fault-tolerant</li>
  <li>Self-correcting</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ul>

<p>These points are very interesting, because for by now we are not talking about just a simple framework which is working, how it is should be, but it has many properties like above mentioned.</p>

<p>I really like the way how the book is guide. Creating something which is more than a bunch of code or a pattern or a framework. Should be more, like a surface which is has it’s own environment.</p>

<p>So, the current situation is that, I’m reading this very cool book (not that long to finish) and I’ll start something to code/implement from it and share it here, because the progress can not stop!</p>
