I"6<p>I can remember the day when I realized the fact that I can make things.. I was 5 or so. I was in the kinder-garden and played with an old toy. One of them was in a really bad shape. But the matter of fact it was the prettiest for me. Not because I played a lot with it, but my own personal view of it..</p>
