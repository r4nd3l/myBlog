<p>Well, the thing is ,what I have already is just a simple percentage based regular front-end framework. It is the â€˜Aâ€™ side of the road. The â€˜Bâ€™ side is going to be much more. This particular â€˜Bâ€™ side should handle the hard stuff. What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>My plan is to reconfigure a regular framework step by step. Of course the exist framework what Iâ€™m working on, is not a bootstrap or a foundation based framework. None of it, because I donâ€™t want to copy any of the them, but in the other hand I believe itâ€™s a good practice how to write my own. So, instead to take one of those I decided to write my own from scratch.</p>

<p>As I wrote above, every column is based on an exact percentage. Currently I use four media query. Small, medium, wide and large. The large gonna be the one where the magic will goes. I would like to extend the content from that size. I still donâ€™t know which method is the best to do this, but I think the CSS itself is not enough here. JavaScript is more suitable, but Iâ€™ll see what I can do.</p>

<div class="code-header">
    <button class="copy-code-button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard"></button>
</div>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/* Between 960px and 640px */
@media screen and (min-width:640px){
.col-wd-1{width: 8.33333%;}
.col-wd-2{width: 16.66667%;}
.col-wd-3{width: 25%;}
.col-wd-4{width: 33.33333%;}
.col-wd-5{width: 41.66667%;}
.col-wd-6{width: 50%;}
.col-wd-7{width: 58.33333%;}
.col-wd-8{width: 66.66667%;}
.col-wd-9{width: 75%;}
.col-wd-10{width: 83.33333%;}
.col-wd-11{width: 91.66667%;}
.col-wd-12{width: 100%;}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a second thing. I donâ€™t want to use any compiler or Js framework. I believe the best choice is to write the lines in their own pure nature/environment. What does it mean? Well, Css variables and VanillaJs. Should be enough, even-though I donâ€™t know, what else (method/solution) could come up during the development process.</p>
