<p>myFlow is a web application for creating mind-maps and other suitable design patterns, written in JavaScript and targeted for web browsers</p>

<ul>
  <li>Templating with JS ES6</li>
  <li>Implementing front-end design with TailWindCSS</li>
  <li>JS based webSocket engine under the hood</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 3 powered server - side project</li>
</ul>

<p>(The figure shows the ER diagram of the mind-map database) (work in progress)</p>

<p>B) Normalization (web app - server)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic goal of normalization is to reduce redundancy, which means that information only needs to be stored once. Repeated storage of information leads to wastage of storage space and an increase in the total size of the data stored</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the database is not designed correctly, it may cause modifications. Modification anomalies occur when data is added, changed, or deleted from the database table. Similarly, in traditional databases as well as in poorly constructed relational databases, data as such can be a redundancy problem. These can be eliminated by normalizing the database</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normalization is the process of breaking a table into smaller tables. In order for each table to cover a single topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three modifications of abnormalities, and the formulation of the first, second, and third normal forms (3NF) is considered sufficient for most practical applications. This can only be considered if we follow a thorough analysis and a full understanding of its consequences</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5.2 Security requirements</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a catastrophic error occurs, for example due to a disk crash, a large part of the database will be severely damaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The recovery method restores a previous copy of the database</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Backup to store the archive, which reconstructs a more current state. Bound transactions are resubmitted and compared from the backup log, of course - until failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5.3 Protection requirements (long term)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security systems, like many other applications, require database storage. However, the special requirements of the security market mean that service providers must carefully select their database partner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5.4 Software Quality Features</p>

<ul>
  <li>** Availability ** - The profile and thus the workspace (s) must be available after using the service, as many customers can ‚Äúqueue online‚Äù at the same time (tumultus)</li>
  <li>** Correct ** - The selected package / service option must generate and load the appropriate or associated desktop setting as intended</li>
  <li>** Sustainability ** - Administrators and users must follow usage policies correctly</li>
  <li>** Usability ** - The mind-map online system must meet the needs of the maximum number of customers and users</li>
</ul>
