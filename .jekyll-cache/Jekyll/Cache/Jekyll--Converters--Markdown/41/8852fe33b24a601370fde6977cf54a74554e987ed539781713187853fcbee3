I"—<p>Itâ€™s been a while that we are searching the â€œrightâ€ tool to get start our process about the platform development. It wasnâ€™t that easy how we imagined at the first place, to just type project management tool in Google and the first 3 hit will be good for us. It is turned out that even we doesnâ€™t have any advance needs, the market about these tools are not that rich.</p>

<p>Our viewpoints looked like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ToDo list â€“ planned goals to accomplish ~each member/team â€“ (maybe with milestones)</li>
  <li>Schedule â€“ Who is available and when, currently who is doing what</li>
  <li>Roadmap viewer â€“ where the project is, checking/pin goals</li>
  <li>Team Organizer â€“ whoâ€™s on what teams, what are they doing</li>
  <li>Tracking the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay donâ€™t get me wrong. The market is rich, but the features? There are already several good tools to star a project. Not to mention the most popular ones â€“ Trello, Slack (even if itâ€™s a chat basically), Flock, Loomio, Zenkit etc. These tools are really good. But our needs also require that tool should be free. Not because we are can not afford it, itâ€™s more like that we are still in the Discover process section. So, it isnâ€™t necessary to get a payed tool to use (yet).</p>

<p>Fortunately, we found some really efficient ones. For example <em>Notion</em>, <em>Taiga</em>, <em>Avaza</em>, <em>Asana</em>  and <em>FreedCamp</em>. With the last one we found ourselves. Itâ€™s free to use, and the bare platform is still rich at the same time. Also it has an app for mobile, which is a big advantage nowadays.</p>

<p>We just started to use the platform, but so far we are satisfied with it. These days are about to try as many features as we can and then we can start the real process. Which is more like back to the subject feeling. Even these dead-ends sometimes are appears the flow should be continue and we should eager to find the solution, no matter what.</p>

<p>Anyway, the following days are gonna be exciting!</p>
