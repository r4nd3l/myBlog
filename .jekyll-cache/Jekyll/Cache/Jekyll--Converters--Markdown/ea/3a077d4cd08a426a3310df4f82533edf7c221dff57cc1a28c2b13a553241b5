I"Ç<p>So, here we are again! And yes, it is in plural for by now. That means, itâ€™s been while Iâ€™m not published, but believe me a have a good reason for this! I started my blog to log my process about a new grid, though I started to do work in a group called Envienta.</p>

<p>Okay, for by now everything is confused.  Iâ€™ll not blog about philosophy. Not here, at least. Instead I would like to share my knowledge. Iâ€™ll blog in several topics and projects within. Some of them will about the web development and stuffs and some of them are more like personal thoughts.</p>

<p>This is the first time for me when Iâ€™m sharing my opinions, so I think itâ€™s gonna be a bit diffuse at the beginning. But Iâ€™ll do my best! The following blog posts will describe some plans and development diaries about a new platform what Iâ€™m working on. Itâ€™s gonna be pretty exciting. At least for me to write these years out of my brain. Itâ€™s gonna be a long way, but so far so good. I just needed a calm place and the time.</p>
