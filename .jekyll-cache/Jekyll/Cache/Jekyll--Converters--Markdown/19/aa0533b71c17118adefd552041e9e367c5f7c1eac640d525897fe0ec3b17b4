I"’<p>I can remember the day when I realized the fact that I can make things.. I was 5 or so. I was in the kinder-garden and played with an old toys. One of them was in a really bad shape. But the matter of fact it was the prettiest for me. Not because I played a lot with it, but my own personal view of it..</p>

<p>Since that day I realized many other things as well in that view or life-style. Watching, seeing and thinking in another way. It sounds kinda ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù when somebody reading this, but it‚Äôs pretty normal for me. The only thing in what I can see or make a difference is that I can compare the past and the present at the same time when I‚Äôm starring at something. I know it sounds strange, but I‚Äôll describe everything later.</p>
