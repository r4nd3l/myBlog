<p>Well, that was it. I donâ€™t know what else can I write, because it was beautiful and interesting and exciting. I learned so many things here. The place is wonderful and the nature is rich and full of life. All of these are recharged my batteries. I like the nature here, I got everything. In the other hand I did so many things for the association and I also got from them.</p>

<p>(The journey)[https://internshipmatemolnarblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/final.jpg?w=1024]</p>

<p>I designed websites and layers, surfaces. There was so many brainstorming. I learned new skills and way of thinking stuffs. I also got some answers for my personal questions how to do that or this. I got new goals and angles how to live my life and how to design things. Iâ€™m really glad to be here and I hope I could continue this project and develop it futher. Actually this project was the main reason why Iâ€™m choosed the Blockchain as a final exam project topic for the 4th semester project.</p>

<p>I got new angles how to build a house. Yes, thatâ€™s could be strange if you read that, but itâ€™s always been there in my mind to design and build a house by myself. So, Iâ€™m very happy to know the know-hows and possibilities how to start and design it step by step. Itâ€™s a special topic for me and itâ€™s also important in general. I mean everyone would like to live on own somewhere sooner or later. Iâ€™m just interested in how to build it from the ground. But now I know there is a lot of chance and possibilities and ways how to do that. I donâ€™t think so itâ€™s necessary to write down again the ENVIENTA solutions, but I would like to live in a house which is self-sustaining.</p>

<p>My goals are expanded now and Iâ€™m rich with these concepts. Otherwise I would like to go further and study more from the IT sections. To learn the back-end coding and much more. Develop an own platform and make connections with people with relevant thinking ways and ideas. To work together and make some very efficient and good stuffs as a service for the people.</p>

<p>I hope you liked my posts and maybe (and itâ€™s a very big maybe) Iâ€™ll continue to write blogs about my goals and life and interesting things which is happened with me during my trips. So, Have a lovely day and I hope you enjoyed my blog! Greetings from Gran Canaria! apr. 2 .â€“ 2016</p>
