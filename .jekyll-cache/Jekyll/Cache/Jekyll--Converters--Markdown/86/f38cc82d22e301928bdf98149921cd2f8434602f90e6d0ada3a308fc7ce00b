I"“<p>I can remember the day when I realized the fact that I can make things.. I was 5 or so. I was in the kinder-garden and played with an old toy. One of them was in a really bad shape. But the matter of fact it was the prettiest for me. Not because I played a lot with it, but my own personal view of it..</p>

<p>Since that day I realized many other things as well in that view of life-style. Watching, seeing and thinking in another way. It sounds kinda ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù when somebody reading this, but it‚Äôs pretty normal for me. The only thing in what I can see or make a difference is that I can compare the past and the present at the same time when I‚Äôm starring at something. I know it sounds strange, but I‚Äôll describe everything later.</p>

<p>Okay, for by now everything is confused.  I‚Äôll not blog about philosophy. Not here, at least. Instead I would like to share my knowledge. I‚Äôll blog in several topics and projects within. Some of them will about the web development and stuffs and some of them are more like personal thoughts.</p>

<p>This is the first time for me when I‚Äôm sharing my opinions, so I think it‚Äôs gonna be a bit diffuse at the beginning. But I‚Äôll do my best! The following blog posts will describe some plans and development diaries about a new platform what I‚Äôm working on. It‚Äôs gonna be pretty exciting. At least for me to write these years out of my brain. It‚Äôs gonna be a long way, but so far so good. I just needed a calm place and the time.</p>
