Experiment of the aquaPon technology with the fish tank, is the place where your fish resides. In an aquaponic system, fish wastes in a fish tank together with water will be pumped to plants beds, providing them with enough moisture and nutrients for their growth. Plants then absorb the nitrogen in the water and return with purified water to the reservoir. And this cycle goes on.
