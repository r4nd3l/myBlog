The ready version of the 3D hologram holder. Made with Google Sketchup and printed with the MakerBot 3D printer. A hologram is a physical recording of an interference pattern which uses diffraction to reproduce a three-dimensional light field, resulting in an image which retains the depth, parallax, and other properties of the original scene. Holography is the science and practice of making holograms.
