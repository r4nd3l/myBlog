The 2nd generation of the iPod Shuffle. It was my original one and I liked it so much that inspired me to recreate it in Google Sketchup. The iPod Shuffle (stylized and marketed as iPod shuffle) is a digital audio player designed and formerly marketed by Apple Inc. It was the smallest model in Apple's iPod family, and was the first iPod to use flash memory.
