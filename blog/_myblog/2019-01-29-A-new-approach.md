So, here we are again! And yes, it is in plural for by now. That means, it’s been while I’m not published, but believe me a have a good reason for this! I started my blog to log my process about a new grid, though I started to do work in a group called Envienta.

![Envienta](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhu.envienta.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F02%2Fenvienta_planet.jpg&f=1){: .mx-auto}

> **ENVIENTA** is a next generation sharing economy model, a DIY maker movement and community-based solution package for the 21st century, which provides share of know-how, blueprints, products and resources for the members.

What we are doing? Well, so many things. The current thread which I’m work on is the marketplace. It’s not an common one, keep in mind that. We all know marketplaces around the globe. Like amazon for example. There are several of them. But not like this kind of. It’s an open-source based “hardware-repo”. Yes, it’s a sort of git, but for hardware. The goal is to create a marketplace where people are able to download blueprints freely and start building things on their own. Sounds awesome for me!

That’s the deal right now, and I can’t wait to begin the project management with them. I’ll continue this blog even I changed the steering wheel and it’s going to a different direction. All these topics are awesome means I’ve to blog about them!
