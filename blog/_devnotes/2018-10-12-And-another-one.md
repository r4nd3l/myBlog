As I wrote in the previous post, the list of these web frameworks are really long. Even-though I did a deep research from past to present about these frameworks, I could not get the perfect one which I am looking for. Of course not, because it’s not exists. I would be the most surprised.

If we go and search for a web frameworks just right now, I’m pretty sure you will find the latest one which is the best at the time. This should be like this. They are following the trends and the “big ones way” how such a web framework should look like and works. But in the other hand not many frameworks are advertised. Therefore we have to find the right one, which is suitable for our needs.

Keeping in mind my plan about the web frameworks, I found another one. It’s called – Neat. This one is came up with the idea which I’m looking for. I’m not tested yet, because the lack of time, but sooner or later I will. I’m curious about it. At the first glance it looks like it’s using compilers and JavaScript. Sounds good so far, except the pre-processor part. But it’s still not bad to learn something from it. I like to understand new approaches like this.

As I checked the documentation of it, seems like the system is adding a new column each time when you need it. But the column system originally is a 12 column grid system. So, actually nothing new. But this JavaScript thingy in the background could handle the rest of these methods to expand the grid when you need it. Which is exactly the way how I want to create such a framework.

The example part of the site is a little bit confusing. The first thing which was came to my mind is that, is it a have-to-thing to refresh the site when the grid system is changed?. If yes then it’s definitely not my type. Compilers are good, but I don’t think so it’s a good for a grid to do the things like this. It is do the job very well, I’m pretty sure, but where the dynamic part from it? Where is the magic (?) which makes everything perfect and smooth? Maybe I’m the one who would like to get more (quality) from these. Anyway, I’m still on the track, so when I’ll get my “Free-time” I’ll continue this project.
