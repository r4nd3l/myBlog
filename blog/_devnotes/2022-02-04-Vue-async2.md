Handy way to fetch data by id from an url (for example from mockapi.io) and reach an array as an endpoint 

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
async mounted() {
  this.fetchPlan(1);
},
methods: {
    async fetchPlan(id) {
    const getPlan = await fetch(
        `https://xyz.mockapi.io/api/plan/${id}`
    );
    const card = await getPlan.json();
    this.wCars = (cars[0]) ? cars[0].w_lessons : null;
    },
}
```
