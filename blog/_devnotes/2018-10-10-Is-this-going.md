Before I do the real deal with my “under construction” web framework, it’s a good idea to gather some information. I did a really deep research about the web frameworks in all time. The list is very long and I believe it’s could be much longer if we take the nowadays too. So, let’s see..

### So what?

What was I looking for? The grid itself. How they made it and built it. Most of them based on a simple grid system which is the FlexBox or the CssGrid. Both of them is fine in a good hand. But not fluid and smooth enough for me. I’m looking for a different way how to adapt the content, no matter which monitor size you have. Just a few of them came up with a different approach.

The Cascade Framework, – Formstone, – Responsee are very cool. I liked them very well. They extended the boundaries with their frameworks and they made a new way to think about the grid. There was an extra one which is the LayersJS. It’s a totally different idea how to create a grid. Anyway, these frameworks are inspired me, but sadly none of them are relatively new. At least for me. So, currently I’m still searching and testing. Beside these I’m also writing little notes about them, advantages and disadvantages. Makes it easier for me to compare them and pulling out the goods, maybe to merge into a new one. I’ll see..
