## National Training Registry (NTR)
A certificate of higher education focuses on either a particular profession or academic subject and is the most basic level of qualification that a student can gain in higher education (unlike the postgraduate certificate of higher education, which we look at later).

A Certificate of Higher Education is an academic qualification that is awarded after a year of full-time study or after 2 years of part-time study.

Completing a CertHE can demonstrate individualsâ€™ capability of studying at university level. It can raise confidence, support a career change, or progression in a current career. It can also be used as the first step of several degree levels to go on to achieve a foundation degree, a diploma of higher education or a DipHE or HND (we have plenty of resources to help you out), or a full honours degree through additional study.

## IT - System Admin
IT administrators oversee organizations' computer systems and manage IT teams. They maintain information systems and networks, upgrade and install new hardware and software, and perform troubleshooting. They also back up data and manage network security.

In the modern workplace, it can be hard to keep up with rapidly changing information, communication and web technologies.

Its main aim is to enhance your knowledge, technical skills and expertise, so it's ideal if you want to develop your professional IT skills and learn how to apply those skills in both commercial and not-for-profit organisations.
